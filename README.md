#  Hobby project

2D engine is designed to be a hobby project of mine in which I try to assess what I have learn't in my classes and be able to apply it
to Computer Science easily. I am using content which I have learn't in Mathematics and Physics at AS level in order to see whether
or not I can code more efficient solutions than previous hobby projects. Any feedback is welcome on my code.
